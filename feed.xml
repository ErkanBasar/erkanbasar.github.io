A Human Evaluation of LLM-generated Reflections for Motivational Interviewing Dialogues</p> <h4 id="abstract">Abstract</h4> <p>Motivational Interviewing (MI) is a counseling technique that promotes behavioral change through reflective responses to mirror or refine client statements. While advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate engaging dialogues, challenges remain for applying them in a sensitive context such as MI. This work assesses the potential of LLMs to generate MI reflections via three LLMs: GPT-4, Llama-2, and BLOOM, and explores the effect of dialogue context size and integration of MI strategies for reflection generation by LLMs. We conduct evaluations using both automatic metrics and human judges on four criteria: appropriateness, relevance, engagement, and naturalness, to assess whether these LLMs can accurately generate the nuanced therapeutic communication required in MI. While we demonstrate LLMs’ potential in generating MI reflections comparable to human therapists, content analysis shows that significant challenges remain. By identifying the strengths and limitations of LLMs in generating empathetic and contextually appropriate reflections in MI, this work contributes to the ongoing dialogue in enhancing LLM’s role in therapeutic counseling.</p> <h4 id="reference">Reference</h4> <ul id="reference" class="tab" data-tab="b0bf1887-4efe-4fa8-9acf-89875685219c" data-name="reference"> <li class="active" id="reference-apa"> <a href="#">APA </a> </li> <li id="reference-bibtex"> <a href="#">BibTeX </a> </li> </ul> <ul class="tab-content" id="b0bf1887-4efe-4fa8-9acf-89875685219c" data-name="reference"> <li class="active"> <p>Basar, E., Sun, X., Hendrickx, I., de Wit, J., Bosse, T., de Bruijn, G., Bosch, J. &amp; Krahmer, E.

The symposium began with a short introduction by <a href="https://www.ru.nl/en/people/bosse-t">Tibor Bosse</a> , and followed by three presentations, delivered by the project’s PhD candidates — <a href="https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/staff/l-he_1">Linwei He</a>, <a href="https://www.uva.nl/en/profile/b/a/d.balaji/d.balaji.html">Divyaa Balaji</a>, and myself — who have been working collaboratively to develop and evaluate chatbots for smoking cessation and safe sex promotion. The event concluded with a panel discussion, driven by the audience’s thought-provoking questions, on the potential and challenges of implementing chatbots in healthcare. The symposium was held on December 10, 2024, in Nijmegen, The Netherlands.</p> <h4 id="engaging-long-term-interactions-with-chatbots-for-health">Engaging Long-Term Interactions with Chatbots for Health</h4> <p>Trying to change a person’s health behaviour is difficult. The services offered by healthcare professionals is proven to be effective, but restricted. Chatbots, as a growing digital technology, on the other hand, hold great promise in supporting this process due to their accessibility, cost-efficiency, and scalability. By incorporating recent insights from the fields of social sciences, humanities, and computational linguistics, we have developed and tested a new generation of chatbots which can engage in long-term motivational interactions in two domains with different social dynamics and complexities; smoking cessation and safe sex promotion. The symposium aims to convey the findings and key insights acquired through the research and analysis conducted in the span of the last 4 years, contributing to the discussions in the fields of behaviour change, communication, human-computer interaction, and artificial intelligence.</p> <h4 id="program">Program</h4> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td>15 min</td> <td>Opening remarks and introduction</td> <td>Tibor Bosse</td> <td>Radboud University</td> </tr> <tr> <td>45 min</td> <td>Chatting Your Way to Quitting</td> <td>Linwei He</td> <td>Tilburg University</td> </tr> <tr> <td>45 min</td> <td>Designing Chatbots for Behaviour Change</td> <td>Divyaa Balaji</td> <td>University of Amsterdam</td> </tr> <tr> <td>45 min</td> <td>Leveraging Large Language Models</td> <td>Erkan Basar</td> <td>Radboud University</td> </tr> <tr> <td>30 min</td> <td>Panel discussion</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <h4 id="chatting-your-way-to-quitting-designing-and-evaluating-chatbots-for-long-term-smoking-cessation-support">Chatting Your Way to Quitting: Designing and Evaluating Chatbots for Long-term Smoking Cessation Support</h4> <p><em>by <a href="https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/staff/l-he_1">Linwei He</a> , Tilburg University</em></p> <p>Can a chatbot truly support long-term change, and is it feasible for people to stay engaged with this kind of digital tool? How do these conversations foster sustained user engagement and even a therapeutic relationship, and what is their impact on behaviour change, particularly quitting smoking? Through iterative design, we developed and evaluated multiple chatbot versions, focusing on feasibility, user experience, and intervention effectiveness. We examined how different conversational strategies influenced motivation and user experience over time. I’ll discuss key findings on these digital interactions and what they mean for the future of chatbots in health support.</p> <h4 id="designing-chatbots-for-behaviour-change-evaluations-of-two-novel-chatbot-concepts-for-promoting-safe-sex-behaviours-in-young-people">Designing Chatbots for Behaviour Change: Evaluations of Two Novel Chatbot Concepts for Promoting Safe Sex Behaviours in Young People</h4> <p><em>by <a href="https://www.uva.nl/en/profile/b/a/d.balaji/d.balaji.html">Divyaa Balaji</a>, University of Amsterdam</em></p> <p>Conversational agents are entering a new era of advanced computing and generative language models; we aspired to push the boundaries of how a conversational agent can support public health, and explored two new chatbot concepts might be used to promote safe sex behaviours in young people: one that targets individuals, and another that targets couples. Through qualitative methods, both chatbots were rigorously evaluated for user acceptance with the intent of understanding how and why users perceived the interactions in certain ways. In this talk, I will consolidate the findings from both evaluations, and discuss how they contribute to our understanding of user acceptance with conversational agents, as well as inform better design in future efforts.</p> <h4 id="leveraging-large-language-models-in-health-promoting-chatbots-in-a-controlled-manner-a-human-centered-approach-and-insights">Leveraging Large Language Models in Health-Promoting Chatbots in a Controlled Manner: A Human-Centered Approach and Insights</h4> <p><em>by <a href="https://erkan.basar.dev/">Erkan Basar</a>, Radboud University</em></p> <p>Can task-oriented long-term chatbots be enhanced through the natural language generation capabilities of large language models like ChatGPT and LLama? How can their capabilities be harnessed in a controlled manner, particularly in sensitive fields such as health counselling? Our research explored these questions by developing a tool with an innovative dialogue manager tailored to integrate these models’ generated utterances into predefined dialogue structures, aiming for controlled and effective communication. By conducting user studies with real conversational data from chatbots focused on smoking cessation and sexual health, we obtained insights into how users perceive the responses generated by large language models. I’ll share key findings on how these digital dialogues shape user engagement and reliability in health counselling scenarios.</p> <h4 id="images">Images</h4> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts/2024-12-10/1-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/posts/2024-12-10/1-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/posts/2024-12-10/1-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts/2024-12-10/1.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts/2024-12-10/2-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/posts/2024-12-10/2-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/posts/2024-12-10/2-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts/2024-12-10/2.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts/2024-12-10/3-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/posts/2024-12-10/3-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/posts/2024-12-10/3-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts/2024-12-10/3.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts/2024-12-10/4-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/posts/2024-12-10/4-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/posts/2024-12-10/4-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts/2024-12-10/4.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <hr/> <p>Find and like this news on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7272626135882964992-095u" target="_blank"><i class="fa-brands fa-linkedin"></i> LinkedIn</a></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="presentation"/><category term="organisation"/><category term="talk"/><category term="symposium"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[We organized the Engaging Long-Term Interactions with Chatbots for Health symposium where we shared our progress and outcomes achieved over the past four years within the multidisciplinary Look Who's Talking project.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Invited Talk at BNAIC2024</title><link href="https://erkanbasar.github.io/news/2024/bnaic-benelearn-2024/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Invited Talk at BNAIC2024"/><published>2024-10-19T23:59:59+00:00</published><updated>2024-10-19T23:59:59+00:00</updated><id>https://erkanbasar.github.io/news/2024/bnaic-benelearn-2024</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://erkanbasar.github.io/news/2024/bnaic-benelearn-2024/"><![CDATA[<div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts/2024-10-19/thumbnail-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/posts/2024-10-19/thumbnail-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/posts/2024-10-19/thumbnail-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts/2024-10-19/thumbnail.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>I had the opportunity to speak and participate in a panel discussion at <a href="https://bnaic2024.sites.uu.nl/">BNAIC2024</a>, where we tackled topics surrounding the recent developments in the field of AI and their impact.

In this paper, we investigate to what extent we can use generative large language models in motivational interviewing chatbots to generate precise and variable reflections on user responses. We conduct a two-step human evaluation where we first independently assess the generated reflections based on four criteria essential to health counseling; appropriateness, specificity, naturalness, and engagement. In the second step, we compare the overall quality of generated and human-authored reflections via a ranking evaluation. We use GPT-4, BLOOM, and FLAN-T5 models to generate motivational interviewing reflections, based on real conversational data collected via chatbots designed to provide support for smoking cessation and sexual health. We discover that GPT-4 can produce reflections of a quality comparable to human-authored reflections. Finally, we conclude that large language models have the potential to enhance and expand reflections in predetermined health counseling chatbots, but a comprehensive manual review is advised.</p> <h4 id="reference">Reference</h4> <ul id="reference" class="tab" data-tab="4ab598ae-0edd-4fe7-8d1f-1eb935e5ec71" data-name="reference"> <li class="active" id="reference-apa"> <a href="#">APA </a> </li> <li id="reference-bibtex"> <a href="#">BibTeX </a> </li> </ul> <ul class="tab-content" id="4ab598ae-0edd-4fe7-8d1f-1eb935e5ec71" data-name="reference"> <li class="active"> <p>Basar, E., Hendrickx, I., Krahmer, E., de Bruijn, G., &amp; Bosse, T.
