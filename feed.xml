This has raised discussions regarding their potential ethical consequences. One application of AI is to help people improve their lifestyle choices and engage in positive behavior change. In the design of such applications, it becomes important to recognize the potential impact that they can have on human autonomy. Human autonomy is a widely discussed topic across various fields of AI applications. It is essential to recognize that human autonomy is a complex concept that requires a nuanced understanding of diverse individuals and their levels of volition. Overall, we argue that chatbots, in the domain of health and lifestyle choices, need to incorporate a capacity to communicate with users about their goals, intentions and reasons for making certain choices, and suggest a way of doing that.</p> <h4 id="reference">Reference</h4> <ul id="reference" class="tab" data-tab="5675a032-f043-4c6f-8b0c-bf52dc10ed92" data-name="reference"> <li class="active" id="reference-apa"> <a href="#">APA </a> </li> <li id="reference-bibtex"> <a href="#">BibTeX </a> </li> </ul> <ul class="tab-content" id="5675a032-f043-4c6f-8b0c-bf52dc10ed92" data-name="reference"> <li class="active"> <p>Basar, E., Balaji, D., He, L., &amp; Haselager, P.

The piece was also subsequently picked up and republished by <a href="https://lc.nl/">Leeuwarder Courant</a>, a regional newspaper based in Friesland.</p> <p>In the interview, I had the chance to share our key insights and findings from my PhD dissertation on the development and evaluation of engaging chatbots for health counselling and the controlled use of large language models. We discussed the potential risks when people rely on AI chatbots for health support and the importance of developing safer, more reliable digital tools. I explained our approach of combining the structure and safety of pre-programmed responses with the engaging, natural language capabilities of large language models (LLMs), while still maintaining human oversight. In our research, we found that responses generated by models like GPT-4 were often rated higher in quality than those written by humans, although some generated utterances were deemed inappropriate and required to be filtered out. I also emphasized the need to use these technologies in a supportive way alongside human care, rather than as standalone solutions, and discussed the broader potential of this method in various fields where both engagement and reliability are critical.</p> <p>Many thanks to <a href="https://www.nrc.nl/">NRC</a> and <a href="https://www.nrc.nl/auteur/ellen-de-bruin/">Ellen de Bruin</a> for bringing attention to our research and giving this topic a platform.</p> <p>Read the full news article, titled “ChatGPT gebruiken als therapeut?

Human Behaviour</a> course at the <a href="https://siks.nl/">SIKS</a> graduate school. During my talk, I discussed the developments in conversational agents, with a particular focus on the development and evaluation of engaging long-term chatbots designed to support users in health behaviour change, which was the central theme of my PhD dissertation and the <a href="https://look.uvt.nl">Look Who’s Talking</a> project. We went on to explore the potential benefits and challenges associated with applying large language models in medical contexts, along with considerations around their controlled use. The workshop component provided me with an opportunity to demonstrate the usage of our hybrid chatbot development software, HyLECA, followed by the audience members attempting to design and create their own chatbots based on the software’s architecture. Overall, it was a valuable experience to contribute to this multidisciplinary exploration of AI’s role in behaviour change, and to engage with other researchers in the area interested in the technical, ethical, and societal implications of these rapidly evolving technologies.</p> <p>The two-day course focused on the intersection of artificial intelligence and human behaviour, specifically exploring how AI technologies can support individuals in voluntarily changing their behaviours across domains such as health, sustainability, and justice. The aim of the course is for the students hear from experts in the field about key technological components of AI-based behaviour support systems and engage in assignments related to these technologies. The program also features real-world examples of AI applications, particularly in health and sustainability, and concludes with an examination of how to promote behaviour change in ways that respect and uphold fundamental societal values such as liberty, autonomy, and social justice.</p> <p>You can find the course details and full agenda at: <a href="https://siks.nl/activities/activities/siks-course-ai-and-human-behaviour/">https://siks.nl/activities/activities/siks-course-ai-and-human-behaviour/</a></p> <h4 id="images">Images</h4> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts/2025-06-24/1-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/posts/2025-06-24/1-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/posts/2025-06-24/1-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts/2025-06-24/1.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"></div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"></div> </div>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="presentation"/><category term="talk"/><category term="lecture"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was invited to give a lecture and workshop as part of the AI & Human Behaviour course at the SIKS graduate school where we discussed health counselling chatbots for long-term engagement.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Organizing NLG in the Lowlands 2025</title><link href="https://erkan.basar.dev/news/2025/nlg-in-lowlands-2025/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Organizing NLG in the Lowlands 2025"/><published>2025-06-19T23:59:59+00:00</published><updated>2025-06-19T23:59:59+00:00</updated><id>https://erkan.basar.dev/news/2025/nlg-in-lowlands-2025</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://erkan.basar.dev/news/2025/nlg-in-lowlands-2025/"><![CDATA[<div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts/2025-06-19/thumbnail-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/posts/2025-06-19/thumbnail-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/posts/2025-06-19/thumbnail-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts/2025-06-19/thumbnail.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>I had the pleasure of being one of the organizers of this year’s <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/nlg-in-the-lowlands-2025/">NLG in the Lowlands</a> workshop, which took place on June 19, 2025, in Tilburg, The Netherlands.

A Human Evaluation of LLM-generated Reflections for Motivational Interviewing Dialogues</p> <h4 id="abstract">Abstract</h4> <p>Motivational Interviewing (MI) is a counseling technique that promotes behavioral change through reflective responses to mirror or refine client statements. While advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate engaging dialogues, challenges remain for applying them in a sensitive context such as MI. This work assesses the potential of LLMs to generate MI reflections via three LLMs: GPT-4, Llama-2, and BLOOM, and explores the effect of dialogue context size and integration of MI strategies for reflection generation by LLMs. We conduct evaluations using both automatic metrics and human judges on four criteria: appropriateness, relevance, engagement, and naturalness, to assess whether these LLMs can accurately generate the nuanced therapeutic communication required in MI. While we demonstrate LLMs’ potential in generating MI reflections comparable to human therapists, content analysis shows that significant challenges remain. By identifying the strengths and limitations of LLMs in generating empathetic and contextually appropriate reflections in MI, this work contributes to the ongoing dialogue in enhancing LLM’s role in therapeutic counseling.</p> <h4 id="reference">Reference</h4> <ul id="reference" class="tab" data-tab="6b4a1218-2b37-47aa-b0c0-5a70ab5ad102" data-name="reference"> <li class="active" id="reference-apa"> <a href="#">APA </a> </li> <li id="reference-bibtex"> <a href="#">BibTeX </a> </li> </ul> <ul class="tab-content" id="6b4a1218-2b37-47aa-b0c0-5a70ab5ad102" data-name="reference"> <li class="active"> <p>Basar, E., Sun, X., Hendrickx, I., de Wit, J., Bosse, T., de Bruijn, G., Bosch, J. &amp; Krahmer, E.

The services offered by healthcare professionals is proven to be effective, but restricted. Chatbots, as a growing digital technology, on the other hand, hold great promise in supporting this process due to their accessibility, cost-efficiency, and scalability. By incorporating recent insights from the fields of social sciences, humanities, and computational linguistics, we have developed and tested a new generation of chatbots which can engage in long-term motivational interactions in two domains with different social dynamics and complexities; smoking cessation and safe sex promotion. The symposium aims to convey the findings and key insights acquired through the research and analysis conducted in the span of the last 4 years, contributing to the discussions in the fields of behaviour change, communication, human-computer interaction, and artificial intelligence.</p> <h4 id="program">Program</h4> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td>15 min</td> <td>Opening remarks and introduction</td> <td>Tibor Bosse</td> <td>Radboud University</td> </tr> <tr> <td>45 min</td> <td>Chatting Your Way to Quitting</td> <td>Linwei He</td> <td>Tilburg University</td> </tr> <tr> <td>45 min</td> <td>Designing Chatbots for Behaviour Change</td> <td>Divyaa Balaji</td> <td>University of Amsterdam</td> </tr> <tr> <td>45 min</td> <td>Leveraging Large Language Models</td> <td>Erkan Basar</td> <td>Radboud University</td> </tr> <tr> <td>30 min</td> <td>Panel discussion</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <h4 id="chatting-your-way-to-quitting-designing-and-evaluating-chatbots-for-long-term-smoking-cessation-support">Chatting Your Way to Quitting: Designing and Evaluating Chatbots for Long-term Smoking Cessation Support</h4> <p><em>by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/linweihe/">Linwei He</a> , Tilburg University</em></p> <p>Can a chatbot truly support long-term change, and is it feasible for people to stay engaged with this kind of digital tool? How do these conversations foster sustained user engagement and even a therapeutic relationship, and what is their impact on behaviour change, particularly quitting smoking? Through iterative design, we developed and evaluated multiple chatbot versions, focusing on feasibility, user experience, and intervention effectiveness. We examined how different conversational strategies influenced motivation and user experience over time.

Through qualitative methods, both chatbots were rigorously evaluated for user acceptance with the intent of understanding how and why users perceived the interactions in certain ways. In this talk, I will consolidate the findings from both evaluations, and discuss how they contribute to our understanding of user acceptance with conversational agents, as well as inform better design in future efforts.</p> <h4 id="leveraging-large-language-models-in-health-promoting-chatbots-in-a-controlled-manner-a-human-centered-approach-and-insights">Leveraging Large Language Models in Health-Promoting Chatbots in a Controlled Manner: A Human-Centered Approach and Insights</h4> <p><em>by <a href="/">Erkan Basar</a>, Radboud University</em></p> <p>Can task-oriented long-term chatbots be enhanced through the natural language generation capabilities of large language models like ChatGPT and LLama? How can their capabilities be harnessed in a controlled manner, particularly in sensitive fields such as health counselling? Our research explored these questions by developing a tool with an innovative dialogue manager tailored to integrate these models’ generated utterances into predefined dialogue structures, aiming for controlled and effective communication. By conducting user studies with real conversational data from chatbots focused on smoking cessation and sexual health, we obtained insights into how users perceive the responses generated by large language models. I’ll share key findings on how these digital dialogues shape user engagement and reliability in health counselling scenarios.</p> <h4 id="images">Images</h4> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts/2024-12-10/1-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/posts/2024-12-10/1-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/posts/2024-12-10/1-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts/2024-12-10/1.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <i>Tibor Bosse</i> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts/2024-12-10/2-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/posts/2024-12-10/2-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/posts/2024-12-10/2-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts/2024-12-10/2.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <i>Linwei He</i> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts/2024-12-10/3-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/posts/2024-12-10/3-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/posts/2024-12-10/3-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts/2024-12-10/3.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <i>Divyaa Balaji</i> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts/2024-12-10/4-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/posts/2024-12-10/4-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/posts/2024-12-10/4-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts/2024-12-10/4.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <i>Erkan Basar</i> </div> </div> <hr/> <p>Find and like this news on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7272626135882964992-095u" target="\_blank"><i class="fa-brands fa-linkedin"></i> LinkedIn</a></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="organization"/><category term="presentation"/><category term="talk"/><category term="symposium"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[We organized the Engaging Long-Term Interactions with Chatbots for Health symposium where we shared our progress and outcomes achieved over the past four years within the multidisciplinary Look Who's Talking project.]]></summary></entry></feed>
