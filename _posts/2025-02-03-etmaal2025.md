I was delighted to discuss the controlled usage of large language models for health-promoting chatbots with the communication science community at this year's [Etmaal van de Communicatiewetenschap](https://etmaal2025.org/). During my talk, I introduced our hybrid chatbot development framework, HyLECA, developed within the [Look Who's Talking](https://look.uvt.nl) project, and shared key findings from our human evaluation studies exploring the use of large language models in chatbot for health, which can be read on [this link]({{ "/news/2024/hcllm-acl2024" | relative_url }}) and [this link]({{ "/news/2025/coling2025" | relative_url }}).

The Etmaal van de Communicatiewetenschap conference is an annual event that brings together communication scholars from the Netherlands and Belgium. This year, the conference was organized by the Department of Communication Science at KU Leuven in cooperation with Netherlands-Flanders Communication Association (NeFCA) on February 3-4 in Bruges, Belgium.
