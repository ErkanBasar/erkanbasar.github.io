I was invited to give a lecture and workshop as part of the [AI & Human Behaviour](https://siks.nl/activities/activities/siks-course-ai-and-human-behaviour/) course at the [SIKS](https://siks.nl/) graduate school. During my talk, I discussed the developments in conversational agents, with a particular focus on the development and evaluation of engaging long-term chatbots designed to support users in health behaviour change, which was the central theme of my PhD dissertation and the [Look Who's Talking](https://look.uvt.nl) project. We went on to explore the potential benefits and challenges associated with applying large language models in medical contexts, along with considerations around their controlled use. The workshop component provided me with an opportunity to demonstrate the usage of our hybrid chatbot development software, HyLECA, followed by the audience members attempting to design and create their own chatbots based on the software’s architecture. Overall, it was a valuable experience to contribute to this multidisciplinary exploration of AI’s role in behaviour change, and to engage with other researchers in the area interested in the technical, ethical, and societal implications of these rapidly evolving technologies.

The two-day course focused on the intersection of artificial intelligence and human behaviour, specifically exploring how AI technologies can support individuals in voluntarily changing their behaviours across domains such as health, sustainability, and justice. The aim of the course is for the students hear from experts in the field about key technological components of AI-based behaviour support systems and engage in assignments related to these technologies. The program also features real-world examples of AI applications, particularly in health and sustainability, and concludes with an examination of how to promote behaviour change in ways that respect and uphold fundamental societal values such as liberty, autonomy, and social justice.
