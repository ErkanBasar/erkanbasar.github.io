I was given the opportunity to present an overview of the [Look Who's Talking](https://look.uvt.nl) project, in the form of a poster, at the _Radboud AI Event: Collaboration for Sustainable Growth_, highlighting our team’s work and summarizing the results and outcomes of our collaboration over the past five years.

Radboud AI Events are organized by the [Radboud AI](https://www.ru.nl/en/departments/interdisciplinair/radboud-ai) at the Radboud University to bring together AI professionals from academia, industry and beyond, to facilitate discussions on artificial intelligence and its application areas. An aftermovie summarizing the event can be watched on YouTube through [this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW3QUOFEQ).
