I participated in organizing the [Personalized Intelligent Conversational Agents (PICA)](https://www.um.org/umap2021/program/workshops.html#PICA) workshop in collaboration with an international team of researchers. The workshop focuses on both long-term, engaging spoken dialogue systems and text-based chatbots, as well as conversational recommender systems. It covers a variety of approaches, including evaluation, design guidelines, personalization, natural language processing, privacy, architectures, frameworks, implementation, and context analysis. Special interest is given to systems that support behavior change and health outcomes. The main goal is to stimulate discussion on how natural language processing and machine learning techniques can be used to learn user features and personalize the dialogue in the next-generation of conversational agents. It was organized as part of [the 29th ACM Conference on User Modeling, Adaptation, and Personalization](https://www.um.org/umap2021/) and took place online on June 21, 2021.
