I am thrilled to share that I successfully defended my dissertation, titled "Responsible and Healthy Conversations: Developing and Evaluating Engaging Chatbots through Controlled Use of Language Models", which marked the completion of my PhD studies in the Behavioural Science Institute at Radboud University.

Reaching this meaningful milestone was made possible by the exceptional guidance and support of my supervisors, Prof. Dr. Tibor Bosse, Dr. Iris Hendrickx, Prof. Dr. Emiel Krahmer, and Prof. Dr. Gert-Jan de Bruijn, and the wonderful collaboration with my project partners Linwei He and Divyaa Balaji. I am deeply grateful to all of them!

Special thanks to the members of my thesis committee, Dr. Serge Thill, Prof. Dr. Walter Daelemans, Prof. Dr. Koen Hindriks, Dr. Charlotte Van Hooijdonk, Dr. Mariët Theune, and Prof. Dr. Elisabeth André, for their valuable time and thought-provoking questions.
