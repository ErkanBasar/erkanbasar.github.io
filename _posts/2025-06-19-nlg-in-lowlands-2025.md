I had the pleasure of being one of the organizers of this year’s [NLG in the Lowlands](https://sites.google.com/view/nlg-in-the-lowlands-2025/) workshop, which took place on June 19, 2025, in Tilburg, The Netherlands. NLG in the Lowlands is an informal workshop that has been held for the past several years, providing a venue for researchers from The Netherlands, Belgium and Germany to exchange ideas and share their work on Natural Language Generation and related topics. This year, the workshop was focused on Multimodality and Large Language Models, and featured invited talks, poster presentations, and opportunities for open discussion.

One personal highlight was presenting findings from our [human evaluation studies]({{ "/news/2024/hcllm-acl2024" | relative_url }}) during the poster session. It was great to connect with others working in the same area and get feedback on our work.
