I was invited to present at this year’s Smooth Operators Festival, where I had the opportunity to share insights and experiences on leveraging large language models in conversational agents with a focus on human-centric design. During our presentation, I presented the key findings from the comprehensive human evaluation studies we’ve conducted within the [Look Who's Talking](https://look.uvt.nl) project, which can be found on [this link]({{ "/news/2024/hcllm-acl2024" | relative_url }}) and [this link]({{ "/news/2025/coling2025" | relative_url }}). The event was organized by the [Smooth Operators](https://www.conversationalagentsresearch.com/) project members and held on June 5 in Tilburg, The Netherlands.
